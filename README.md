## Overview

The app comunicates through MQTT with a servo motor, controlling its rotation, and with a DHT11, showing its data. Both sensors are managed by a ESP32 board.

## Features

- Control servo rotation: drag the circular slider to the desired angle.
- Get DHT11 data: show temperature, humidity and heat index.

## Hardware description

- ESP32 board.
- 10 kÎ© resistor.
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.
- SG90 servo motor.
- Jumpers.
- Android phone or simulator.

## Software description
- Android
  - [HiveMQ](https://github.com/hivemq) for MQTT communication.
  - Jetpack compose for building the screen.
  - Hilt for dependency injection.
  - Assets from [Free SVG](https://freesvg.org/) website.
- ESP32
  - Arduino IDE.
  - `ESP32Servo.h` for servo control.
  - `DHT.h` for DHT11 data.
  - `PubSubClient.h` for MQTT topics publishing and subscription.
  - `WiFi.h` for internet connection.
- Broker
  - I've used the [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/public-mqtt-broker/) public broker, but it's also possible to use a custom one like [Mosquitto](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu-sn&q=mosquitto). For MQTT over TLS this app should have some configs more, but the [HiveMQ](https://github.com/hivemq) library also provides this feature.

- The circular slider was based on [ComposeCircularSlider](https://github.com/Debdutta-Panda/ComposeCircularSlider) project.
